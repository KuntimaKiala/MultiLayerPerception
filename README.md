# Mutilayer Perception 
A C++ Multilayer Perception no libraries  <br />
I just wanted to create it from strach for c++ studying purposes<br />
XOR


## Usage :
g++ main.cpp SimpleNeuralNetWork.cpp Topology.cpp Neurons.cpp Matrix.cpp -o run  <br />

# NB : 
Since everything is created from scratch even the Matrix library the performance might not be the best
